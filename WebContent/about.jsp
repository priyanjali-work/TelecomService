When it comes to personalizing your online store, nothing is more effective personalizing the things. This is a quick summary of your company's history and purpose, and should provide a clear overview of the company's brand story.
 A great About Us page can help tell your brand story, establish customer loyalty, and turn your bland ecommerce store into an well-loved brand icon. Most importantly, it will give your customers a reason to shop from your brand.

In this post, we'll give you three different ways to create a professional about us page for your online store, 
blog, or other website - use our about us page generator, use the fill-in-the-blank about us template below, or create your own custom page using the about us examples within this article.

If there's a business that knows how to speak their customers' language,
 it's Centaur Guitar. This rock and roll shop opens their About Us page with the bold statement, "Different. Just like You," and delivers on that promise. From recounting the founders' days playing midnight rock shows, to calling out their guitar megastore competitors, the content on and tone of this page is down-to-earth, 
no frills and no-nonsense, just like their business.

Many merchants underestimate the impact that a well-written About Us page can make on their business. Use one of the three methods above to write a perfect summary of your brand's history, mission, and goals, and start turning browsers into loyal customers.
