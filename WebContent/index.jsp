    <h2>Welcome to Telecom service</h2>
    
    <p>Mobile number portability (MNP) is a service that allows a cellphone or smartphone customer to change telecom carrier and keep the same phone number.

The lack of number portability between wireless carriers has kept many consumers in India from changing cell phone service providers. Now that the infrastructure is finally in place.

So, we come up with a solution in telecom services for easy portability of SIM or network. Before the portability a verification call will be send by the company to user to know their issue for finding an alternate way.


    </p>
    
    <p>Using this application any one  can send request  for portability of SIM or network and that request will be verified by admin.

       During the process customer can see the status of request on their profile.

        All these process can be done from anywhere.
